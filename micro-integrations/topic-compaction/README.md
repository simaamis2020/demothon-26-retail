# Topic Compaction Micro-Integration

A Solace Micro-Integration that maintains a key-value store of the
last-seen message per Solace topic, with on-demand single + bulk
replay, synchronous request/reply lookup, REST admin surface,
TTL retention, and streaming backup/restore. A Solace-native
alternative to Kafka log compaction.

> **Built on**: Solace MDK 3.0.6 + Spring Boot 3.5 + Spring Cloud
> Stream Solace binder + RocksDB.
>
> **Status**: V1.0.0 -- production-ready single-replica deployment
> on Kubernetes. HA is a V2 deliverable (see ADR 0002).

## What it does

| Workflow | Input | Action | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 - Compaction** | `compaction.data` (default sub: `orders/>`) | Stores latest message per topic in RocksDB | `<topic>/compacted-ack` audit JSON |
| **1 - Replay (single)** | `compaction.commands` (`compacted/command/>`) | Looks up KV, republishes | `<key>/compacted` |
| **1 - Bulk replay** | same | Pattern-iterates, fans out via output-3, throttled | `<key>/compacted` per match + summary on `topic-compaction/replay/bulk-result` |
| **1 - Delete** | same | Tombstones key (+ optional cascade pattern) | `topic-compaction/delete/result` |
| **2 - Lookup** | `compaction.lookup` (`compacted/lookup/>`) | Solace Request/Reply | `solace_replyTo` of the request |
| **REST KV** | HTTP `:8090/api/v1/kv` | Direct GET/list/DELETE | JSON / raw payload |
| **REST Admin** | HTTP `:8090/api/v1/admin` | Streaming backup / restore | NDJSON |
| **Retention** | scheduled sweeper | Per-prefix TTL eviction | metric increments |

## Why this exists

See `docs/DIFFERENTIATORS.md` for the full comparison vs Kafka log
compaction. Highlights:

- **Immediate compaction** (no eventual cleanup background process)
- **Direct O(1) lookup** via REST and Solace Request/Reply
- **Pattern-based bulk replay** for cache-warmup / disaster recovery
- **Per-prefix TTL retention** instead of a single topic-level knob
- **Streaming backup / restore** with a versioned NDJSON format
- **Hierarchical topic ingestion** via Solace wildcards (`orders/>`)

## Two deployment modes

### docker-compose (local / dev)

```bash
make env-init         # cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env          # broker creds, optional REST auth
make build            # mvn package
make image            # build container via jib
make up               # docker compose up -d
make smoke            # 10 assertions, exit 0 on success
make down             # tear down (volumes preserved)
```

### Kubernetes (lab / production-shaped)

```bash
make k8s-deploy       # idempotent: namespace, ConfigMap, Secret,
                      # PVC, Deployment, Service, NetworkPolicy,
                      # ServiceMonitor, PrometheusRule,
                      # Grafana dashboard
make k8s-status       # pods, svc, pvc, monitoring
make k8s-logs         # tail JSON logs
make k8s-port-forward # 18090 -> service:8090
make k8s-undeploy     # tear down (PVC + namespace preserved)
make k8s-undeploy-purge   # full teardown including PVC
```

The K8s overlay deploys the MI to namespace `mi-solace-lab`, with
hardened pod (non-root, read-only-rootFS, dropped capabilities,
seccomp), 10 Gi PVC, NetworkPolicy + PodDisruptionBudget. The
monitoring artifacts (ServiceMonitor, PrometheusRule, Grafana
dashboard) deploy into the cluster's `monitoring` namespace
alongside the kube-prometheus stack. See ADR 0003 for the
topology decisions.

## Tests

```bash
./mvnw test               # 111 tests (105 unit + 6 integration)
./mvnw verify             # adds JaCoCo coverage check
make smoke                # broker-integrated 10-assertion check
make load-test            # bash + curl harness
```

End-to-end testing is documented in `docs/SMOKE-TEST.md`.

## Quick smoke-test recipes (curl)

All recipes assume the project's `.env` is sourced and a port-
forward to the MI's REST endpoint is running:

```bash
. .env
kubectl -n mi-solace-lab port-forward svc/topic-compaction-mi 18090:8090 &
```

### 1. Compaction (publish + KV verification)

Publish via Solace REST (PERSISTENT, lands in `compaction.data`
queue, MI upserts to KV, fires DIRECT audit on
`<topic>/compacted-ack`):

```bash
curl -i -X POST -u "$SOLACE_REST_USER:$SOLACE_REST_PASS" \
  "$SOLACE_REST_HOST/orders/v110-final/test/A" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"orderId":"A","amount":100}'
```

Verify the upsert via the MI's REST KV API (no Solace round-trip):

```bash
curl -i -u "$MI_ADMIN_NAME:$MI_ADMIN_PASSWORD" \
  "http://localhost:18090/api/v1/kv/orders/v110-final/test/A"
# → 200 with payload + x-compacted-topic + x-compacted-ingest-timestamp
```

### 2. Lookup (KV read)

The MI's REST KV API is the canonical curl-friendly lookup path.
The Solace Request/Reply lookup workflow exists for SMF/JCSMP
clients that publish PERSISTENT to `compacted/lookup/<key>`; it
is **not** reachable via Solace REST `/REQUESTS/...` because the
REST gateway publishes Direct Messages and durable queues only
spool guaranteed traffic (see V1.1.4 changelog note).

```bash
# HIT (returns the stored payload as the body)
curl -i -u "$MI_ADMIN_NAME:$MI_ADMIN_PASSWORD" \
  "http://localhost:18090/api/v1/kv/orders/v110-final/test/A"

# MISS
curl -i -u "$MI_ADMIN_NAME:$MI_ADMIN_PASSWORD" \
  "http://localhost:18090/api/v1/kv/orders/does/not/exist"
# → 404

# List with prefix filter (mi-user role is sufficient)
curl -i -u "$MI_USER_NAME:$MI_USER_PASSWORD" \
  "http://localhost:18090/api/v1/kv?prefix=orders/v110-final/"

# DELETE a key directly (admin only, no Solace round-trip)
curl -i -X DELETE -u "$MI_ADMIN_NAME:$MI_ADMIN_PASSWORD" \
  "http://localhost:18090/api/v1/kv/orders/v110-final/test/A"
```

### 3. REPLAY commands via Solace REST

Single-key replay:

```bash
curl -X POST -u "$SOLACE_REST_USER:$SOLACE_REST_PASS" \
  "$SOLACE_REST_HOST/TOPIC/compacted/command/replay" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Solace-Delivery-Mode: persistent" \
  --data '{"command":"REPLAY","key":"orders/v110-final/test/A"}'
```

Pattern-based bulk replay:

```bash
curl -X POST -u "$SOLACE_REST_USER:$SOLACE_REST_PASS" \
  "$SOLACE_REST_HOST/TOPIC/compacted/command/bulk-replay" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Solace-Delivery-Mode: persistent" \
  --data '{"command":"BULK_REPLAY","pattern":"orders/v110-final/*/*","options":{"correlationId":"smoke-001"}}'
```

DELETE command (with optional cascade):

```bash
curl -X POST -u "$SOLACE_REST_USER:$SOLACE_REST_PASS" \
  "$SOLACE_REST_HOST/TOPIC/compacted/command/delete" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Solace-Delivery-Mode: persistent" \
  --data '{"command":"DELETE","key":"orders/v110-final/test/A"}'
```

The replay messages and command summaries are observed by
subscribing to the relevant topics in TryMe (or any DIRECT
subscriber):

```
orders/*/*/*/compacted              # the replayed payloads
topic-compaction/replay/bulk-result # BULK_REPLAY summaries
topic-compaction/replay/failed      # parse / validation failures
topic-compaction/delete/result      # DELETE summaries
orders/*/*/*/compacted-ack          # per-message audit events
```

## V1.x backlog

Items deliberately deferred from V1.0 (with rationale in CHANGELOG):

- High availability via active-standby + state replication
  (ADR 0002).
- Testcontainers-based end-to-end tests with a real Solace
  broker (replaces the smoke-test.sh approach for CI).
- sdkperf-based load harness for sustained > 500 msg/s.
- Per-workflow latency histograms separate from the generic
  Spring `http.server.requests` series.
- mTLS at the REST listener (HTTP today; Ingress TLS termination
  is the V1 pattern).
- OIDC for human operators (in-memory user store today).
